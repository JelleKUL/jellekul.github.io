# Object and texture completion of partial 3D scanned objects

## Introduction

Completing 3D models of partial 3D scanned objects, both using existing geometry completion networks and finding new texture completion thingy. The main contribution will be using the existing partial texture data to complete the rest of the mesh.

## Background and Related Work

- A lot of research in geometry completion
- A lot of research in object texturing
- A lot of research on image inpainting
- Not a lot on texture completion

## Methodology

### Implicit surface generation
Convert the incomplete meshes to voxelgrids as input for the networks

### Material segmentation
Use material detection to segment the uv mep of the object into distinct materials

### Geometry prediction

#### Occlusion detection

#### Surface meshing

### Texture inpainting

#### UV unwrapping

#### inpainting
