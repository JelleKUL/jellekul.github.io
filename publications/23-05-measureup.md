Each student's progress get's stored in the game through a connection with the Shibboleth KU Leuven CAS. This way, students can pick up where they last left off without having to remember extra passwords. This data is also available to the teachers where they can guage the general understanding of each topic and uncover pain points in the curriculum.
Each distinct topic in the curriculum has it's own section and unique challenges. 

## Frontal view height & distance measuring

Players can place measures and beacons to measure height differences between points.
Once the player enters a correct value, their score will increase.

## Topdown view distance & angle measuring
