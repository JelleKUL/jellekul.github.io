# Scene Completion

## Introduction

- Capturing scenes with scanners leads to a lot of occlusion

### Semantic Scene completion
[3D Semantic Scene Completion: A Survey](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-021-01504-5)
> Semantic scene completion (SSC) aims to jointly estimate the complete geometry and semantics of a scene, assuming partial sparse input. In the last years following the multiplication of large-scale 3D datasets, SSC has gained significant momentum in the research community because it holds unresolved challenges.

[CIRCLE: Convolutional Implicit Reconstruction and Completion for Large-scale Indoor Scene](https://github.com/otakuxiang/circle)
> CIRCLE is a framework for large-scale scene completion and geometric refinement based on local implicit signed distance function.

## Datasets

- Scanned datasets are incomplete, so they have no ground truth
- Synthetic datasets are complete and need to be abstracted to create  incomplete ones
