description: XR devices can capture multi-sensory data. To make sure the data is captured and stored correctly, an application was made using the Unity game engine. It is built on the AR Foundation framework to ensure multi-platform support, ranging from smartphones to XR devices. This package can be imported in any Unity project following the instructions on the Github repo.
