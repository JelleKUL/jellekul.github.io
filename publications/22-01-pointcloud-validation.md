description: XR devices can capture multi-sensory data. To make sure the data is captured and stored correctly, an application was made using the Unity game engine. It is built on the AR Foundation framework to ensure multi-platform support, ranging from smartphones to XR devices. This package can be imported in any Unity project following the instructions on the Github repo.

 ABSTRACT = {Building Information models created from laser scanning inputs are becoming increasingly commonplace, but the automation of the modeling and  evaluation is still a subject of ongoing research. Current advancements mainly target the data interpretation steps, i.e., the instance and semantic  segmentation by developing advanced deep learning models. However, these steps are highly influenced by the characteristics of the laser scanning  technologies themselves, which also impact the reconstruction/evaluation potential. In this work, the impact of different data acquisition techniques  and technologies on these procedures is studied. More specifically, we quantify the capacity of static, trolley, backpack, and head-worn mapping  solutions and their semantic segmentation results such as for BIM modeling and analyses procedures. For the analysis, international standards and  specifications are used wherever possible. From the experiments, the suitability of each platform is established, along with the pros and cons of each  system. Overall, this work provides a much needed update on point cloud validation that is needed to further fuel BIM automation.},
