 abstract = {The AEC industry struggles with integrating close-range sensing data like photogrammetric and LiDAR outputs due to the vast volume of  unstructured 2D and 3D data, hindering tasks like digital twinning and construction monitoring. Although semantic web technologies have effectively  managed diverse resources in other domains, their potential in handling construction-related sensing data remains unrealized, further complicated by the  absence of a comprehensive data management framework for construction projects. This paper bridges the gap between various close-range sensing resources  and AEC industry tasks by integrating Linked Data RDF Graphs with advanced geomatics algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that this close-range  linked data methodology effectively combines sensory data processing with RDF Graphs, thereby enabling more efficient resolution of construction process  queries. The GEOMAPI framework significantly improves access to close-range sensing data for construction stakeholders, facilitate complex geomatics  computations, and stores multi-temporal analysis results, thereby advancing the capabilities in the AEC sector.}
